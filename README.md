# 🌟 AI Stress Predictor & Chatbot 😌

This repository contains the **AI Stress Predictor & Chatbot**, a machine learning-powered web application built using **Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, and Google Gemini AI**. The project predicts stress levels based on user input and provides **personalized relaxation tips** and an **AI wellness assistant** for interactive conversations.

## 🔥 Features  
- **Stress Prediction Model** 🤖: Uses a trained ML model to predict stress levels based on sleep, study hours, and feeling of being overwhelmed.  
- **Streamlit UI** 🎨: An interactive and user-friendly interface for seamless predictions and chatbot interactions.  
- **Google Gemini AI Integration** ✨: Enables AI-powered conversations and wellness suggestions.  
- **Custom Styling** 🎭: Enhanced UI with emojis, images, and smooth UX.  
- **Preprocessing & Scaling** 📊: Utilizes a trained scaler for input transformation.
